## ROBOT 1

Implement a wall following robot using a subsumption architecture. Your environment
should be surrounded by a wall.

## ROBOT 2

Implement a garbage collection robot. For this, you can use the robot architecture (controller) of your choice.Your environment should be surrounded by a wall and also contain obstacles and other objects to
be used as “garbage”. The robot must move the “garbage” scattered around the environment to a specific place, e.g., by the wall, inside a spotlight, inside a small area of the arena, etc.

## ROBOT 3

Implement a robot that can solve a “two resource problem” in the environment of your choice. For this robot, you need to use a motivated architecture that uses a simulated physiology of homeostatically controlled variables, as well as appropriate motivations and
behaviors.
